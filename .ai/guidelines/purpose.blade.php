# All-in-One Company Management System for Starfolk

## Product Requirements Document

### Overview and Objectives

Starfolk’s internal management system aims to unify CRM, project management, marketing automation, and analytics into a single platform. The goal is to eliminate data silos and manual work by providing an **all-in-one tool** that manages clients, sales, marketing, and product growth in one place[\[1\]](https://softhealer.com/it-company-management-system#:~:text=An%20IT%20Company%20Management%20System,within%20a%20single%2C%20centralized%20system). This system will give Starfolk complete visibility into key operations through integrated dashboards and KPIs[\[2\]](https://softhealer.com/it-company-management-system#:~:text=A%20Fully%20Customized%20Odoo%20Platform,Dashboards%2C%20KPIs%2C%20and%20Business%20Intelligence), enabling smarter decision-making. By consolidating these functions, the company can streamline workflows, improve collaboration, and scale more efficiently without juggling multiple apps.

### User Roles & Permissions

The system will support **1–10 internal users** initially, with a flexible role-based permission model. Administrators can create custom roles by toggling granular permissions (e.g. “Manage Clients”, “Manage Tasks”, “View Analytics”, “Publish Content”). This ensures each user has appropriate access. For example, a *Sales* role may have CRM and Deals permissions but not Marketing, whereas a *Marketing* role can manage campaigns and content. The Laravel+Vue starter kit provides an authentication foundation to build on, including user accounts, password security, and session management. We will extend this to include role assignment and middleware checks so that sensitive actions (like deleting a client or configuring integrations) are restricted to authorized roles. All user activity will be behind a secure login, and the app will enforce data privacy by role-based data scoping.

### Functional Requirements and Features

#### *CRM – Client & Lead Management*

The system will include a **mini-CRM module** to manage contacts (both leads and clients). Users can create and update contact profiles with details like name, company, contact info, status, and notes. There will be functionality to **capture new leads** via a quick form or import, and integrate with external sources – for example, leads captured from website contact forms can automatically flow into the CRM[\[3\]](https://softhealer.com/it-company-management-system#:~:text=,Integration%20with%20website%2Fcontact%20forms). Users can track each lead’s status (New, Contacted, Qualified, etc.) and nurture prospects through the sales funnel, recording interactions and follow-up reminders. When a lead converts to a paying client, the system can mark them as a client and possibly trigger onboarding tasks. The CRM will support searching and filtering (e.g. find all leads from a certain campaign or all clients in a certain industry). It will also allow bulk actions like sending a group email (tied into the Email Marketing module). This **centralized contact database** ensures the team can “track leads, nurture prospects, and close deals efficiently” with an organized pipeline[\[4\]](https://softhealer.com/it-company-management-system#:~:text=CRM%20For%20IT%20Company).

#### *Deals Pipeline Management*

In conjunction with the CRM, the system will provide a **Deals/Opportunities module** to manage potential sales deals. Users can create a Deal record linked to one or more contacts (e.g. a sales opportunity with a lead) and assign properties like deal value, expected close date, and current stage. Stages will be customizable (e.g. *Prospect*, *Demo*, *Proposal Sent*, *Closed Won*, *Closed Lost*) and presented in a visual **sales pipeline** (kanban board or list) for easy tracking. The team can update a deal’s stage by drag-and-drop (in a kanban view) or with a status dropdown. The system will support adding notes or attaching documents (e.g. proposals) to each deal. A **pipeline summary** view will show metrics like total open deals, total potential value, and conversion rates per stage – helping Starfolk monitor sales performance and revenue forecasts. When a deal is marked “Closed Won,” the associated lead can automatically be converted to a Client in the CRM, and any “Closed Lost” deals can prompt capturing a reason for loss (for analysis). This deals management ensures no opportunity falls through the cracks and sales efforts are tracked methodically[\[4\]](https://softhealer.com/it-company-management-system#:~:text=CRM%20For%20IT%20Company).

#### *Task Management*

The platform will include a robust **Task Management** feature to organize internal projects and to-dos. Users can create tasks with title, description, due date, assignee, priority, and status. Tasks can be grouped by project or category (for example, by product or department), enabling a lightweight project management experience. The interface will allow viewing tasks in a list (with sorting and filtering by status, assignee, etc.) and possibly a **Kanban board** or calendar view for scheduling. Key capabilities include assigning tasks to team members, setting deadlines (with reminders for upcoming or overdue tasks), and tracking progress through statuses like *To Do*, *In Progress*, *Done*. For better project control, we may implement sub-tasks or checklists within a task, and support file attachments or links (e.g. attaching specifications or images to a task). Team members can comment on tasks (for clarification or updates), and the assignee will get notifications for new tasks or mentions. This module will help Starfolk “manage complex projects, timelines, and deliverables” by delegating work clearly and tracking it to completion[\[5\]](https://softhealer.com/it-company-management-system#:~:text=Manage%20complex%20client%20projects%2C%20timelines%2C,and%20deliverables). Managers can quickly see workload and statuses, ensuring projects stay on schedule. (Advanced features like time tracking or Gantt charts are optional future enhancements if needed for billing or detailed planning.)

#### *Product Management*

To help **manage and grow Starfolk’s products**, the system will have a module for product information and oversight. Starfolk offers both SaaS and info products; this feature will let the team catalog all products in one place. For each product, users can record key details: description, product type, launch date, current version, URLs (landing page, documentation, etc.), and current performance metrics. The product profiles can also list associated tasks, leads/deals, and content. For example, a user viewing “Product X” can see open tasks related to Product X (from the Task module), sales deals in progress for Product X, and marketing content (emails or posts) related to it. We will integrate product-specific **KPIs** here – e.g. for a SaaS product, perhaps number of active users or MRR (monthly recurring revenue), which could be entered manually or synced via an API. For info products, metrics like sales volume or customer satisfaction could be tracked. The system might allow setting growth goals per product (e.g. increase user count by 20% this quarter) and track progress. This centralized product dashboard ensures each product’s health and growth initiatives are monitored. Additionally, linking products to tasks and campaigns keeps efforts aligned with product goals. (In the future, deeper integrations like pulling usage stats from the product’s database or Stripe revenue data could feed into this module for real-time product performance tracking.)

#### *Email Marketing Campaigns*

The platform will include an **Email Marketing** component tightly integrated with the CRM contacts. Users (with the appropriate marketing permissions) can design and send email campaigns to selected groups of leads or clients. The feature will offer a template-driven email composer (with a rich text editor to format content, insert images, links, etc., and possibly save templates for reuse). Users can create segments or simply select recipients based on CRM filters (e.g. all leads from last month, or all clients who bought a certain product). For each campaign, they can schedule a send time or send immediately. The system will leverage Laravel’s mailing capabilities or integrate with an email service (SMTP or API like SendGrid) to dispatch emails in bulk while handling bounces and unsubscribes. After sending, the system will track basic **email metrics** – such as delivery status, open rates and click-through rates – and display these in a campaign report. (Tracking may involve generating unique tracking links or a tiny pixel for opens; we will include this if feasible for richer analytics, as many CRM email tools do[\[6\]](https://www.nutshell.com/marketing/resources/crms-and-email-marketing#:~:text=HubSpot%20Access%20to%20automated%20sequences%2C,throughs%2C%20and%20downloads).) The email module also supports drip campaigns or sequences: for example, an automated welcome email when a new lead is added, followed by a follow-up after a few days. This may be configured via simple rules (e.g. send Email Template X to any new lead after 1 day). All email interactions will be logged under the contact’s history in the CRM (e.g. “Newsletter August 2025 – Opened by client”). By combining CRM data with email marketing, Starfolk can nurture prospects and customers with targeted messaging[\[7\]](https://www.nutshell.com/marketing/resources/crms-and-email-marketing#:~:text=testing%2C%20and%20integrations%20with%20250,throughs%2C%20and%20downloads). The system’s native email marketing capabilities mean the team doesn’t have to export contacts to an external tool – it’s handled in one place for convenience and consistency.

#### *Social Media & Ads Integration*

To support Starfolk’s marketing efforts, the system will integrate with major social platforms – specifically **Meta (Facebook & Instagram)** and **X (Twitter)** – as well as Meta’s Ads Manager. Users will be able to connect their company Facebook/Instagram and Twitter accounts via OAuth for API access. Key functionalities include: \- **Social Media Posting:** From within the system, marketing users can draft and publish posts/tweets to Facebook, Instagram, and X. They can attach images or links and publish immediately or schedule future posts. A content calendar view will show scheduled posts across platforms, helping coordinate campaigns. \- **Social Analytics:** The system will pull in engagement metrics for posts (likes, shares, comments, retweets) and follower counts via the APIs. This data can feed into the KPI dashboard for a consolidated view of social impact. \- **Advertising Data:** By integrating with Meta Ads Manager, the tool can fetch ad campaign performance metrics – impressions, clicks, conversion, ad spend, etc. – for campaigns related to Starfolk’s products. These metrics will be visible in the dashboard or a dedicated ads insight page, allowing the team to monitor ROI on ads without logging into separate platforms. We will also explore capturing leads from Facebook Lead Ads via webhooks or API – so if a user fills a lead form on a Facebook ad, that lead’s data can automatically create a new lead entry in the CRM. \- **Unified View:** By marrying social media data with the CRM, Starfolk gains “superior analytics and automation capabilities” – for example, seeing which social channel yields the most leads[\[8\]](https://www.flowlu.com/blog/crm/integrate-your-social-media-with-crm/#:~:text=By%20integrating%20Social%20Media%20with,ambitious%20marketing%20and%20sales%20goals). The integration helps reach ambitious marketing goals by connecting audience engagement directly to the sales pipeline.  
\- **Social Listening (Future):** In the future, we could add social listening (monitoring brand mentions, comments, messages) in the system. For now, primary focus is on outbound posting and inbound metrics.

All credentials (API tokens) for these integrations will be stored securely (encrypted in the database). Webhooks will be used where possible for real-time updates – e.g. if Meta provides a webhook for new leads or comments, the system will capture those events to alert the team, ensuring timely responses. This social module enables Starfolk to plan, execute, and analyze multi-channel marketing from one interface, instead of hopping between Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.

#### *AI Content Generation*

A standout feature will be **automatic content generation using AI**. This integrates an AI writing assistant (likely via OpenAI GPT-4 API or similar) directly into the system to help create marketing content. Users can choose content types such as **blog posts, product copy, ad creatives, or social media posts** and input prompts or keywords. For example, a user could request “Blog post about \[Product A\]’s new feature targeting \[target audience\]” or “5 Tweet ideas to promote \[Product B\] launch.” The AI integration will then generate a draft of the requested content. Users can review and edit the AI-generated content to add the human touch and ensure accuracy before using it. Generated content can be saved into the system: e.g. blog post drafts could be saved under the Content section or attached to a Product, ready for publishing. Similarly, AI-generated social posts can be scheduled in the Social module, and email copy can be inserted into the Email campaign composer. This feature will greatly speed up content creation; in fact, **42% of companies are turning to automatic content generation** to help their teams instantly create tailored content for buyers[\[9\]](https://www.highspot.com/blog/sales-content-automation/#:~:text=42,of%20Sales%20Enablement%20Report%202025). By leveraging AI, Starfolk’s small team can produce more high-quality content with less effort, supporting their marketing and sales enablement strategies. The system will also maintain a library or history of generated content to avoid duplication and allow reusing or iterating on past AI outputs. (Admin controls will ensure the AI is used responsibly – e.g. setting maximum lengths, guiding tones, and preventing any confidential data from being sent to the AI API.)

#### *Analytics Dashboard (KPI Tracking)*

The platform will provide a comprehensive **Analytics Dashboard** to track KPIs across all the above modules. This dashboard is the heart of the “visibility” goal – a one-stop overview of how the business is performing. It will feature interactive charts and summary cards for metrics such as: \- **Sales/CRM KPIs:** number of new leads captured this month, conversion rate (leads to deals), number of deals won vs lost, total sales revenue (if input or integrated), etc. \- **Marketing KPIs:** email campaign open/click rates, new email subscriptions, social media followers growth, engagement metrics (from the integrated social data), and ad campaign ROI (impressions, clicks, conversions, cost per lead from Meta Ads, etc.). \- **Product KPIs:** usage metrics per product (if available), customer retention or churn rate, and other product-specific goals. \- **Task/Project KPIs:** tasks completed vs pending, project completion percentages, team productivity stats (e.g. tasks closed per week). \- **Overall Business KPIs:** any high-level indicators like total revenue, expenses (if tracked), or website traffic (if integrated via something like Google Analytics in future).

Users (especially managers or executives) can customize the time range (e.g. view metrics for the last week, month, quarter). The dashboard might allow drilling down: for instance, clicking on “leads this month” could bring up the list of those new leads; or clicking on an email open rate chart could show which contacts are engaged. We will use charts (bar, line, pie as appropriate) to visualize trends and distributions. The design will emphasize clarity: e.g. a big number for each key KPI and sparkline for trend. This dashboard fulfills the need for **“complete visibility through dashboards, KPIs, and business intelligence”** in an all-in-one management suite[\[2\]](https://softhealer.com/it-company-management-system#:~:text=A%20Fully%20Customized%20Odoo%20Platform,Dashboards%2C%20KPIs%2C%20and%20Business%20Intelligence). Technically, it will involve aggregating data from MySQL (internal data) and calling external APIs for latest social/ad stats. We will implement caching or scheduled data fetches to keep the dashboard performant. Having this live pulse on Starfolk’s operations will enable data-driven decisions and quick identification of issues or opportunities.

#### *Webhooks & External Integration*

To maximize integration possibilities, the system will support **webhooks** for external tools. This means certain events in our system can trigger an HTTP POST with relevant data to a URL configured by the user. For example, when a **new lead** is created in the CRM, a webhook can notify an external system (perhaps a Slack channel or a Google Sheets log). Other webhook events could include: new deal created or stage changed, task completed, new user added, or even when an AI content piece is generated (if Starfolk wants to log content externally). Admin users will have an interface to configure webhook endpoints and select which events to subscribe to. Conversely, the system will also expose endpoints to handle **incoming webhooks** from external sources. For instance, if the Starfolk marketing website has a signup form and can send a webhook on submission, our system can receive that and automatically create a lead. Similarly, Meta Lead Ads could be set to call our webhook endpoint with lead info, injecting leads directly into the CRM in real-time. Security will be considered – e.g. verifying incoming webhook signatures or requiring a secret token, to ensure we only accept legitimate requests. With this bi-directional webhook support, the Starfolk tool can integrate with countless external apps (like Zapier, etc.) beyond the built-in integrations, providing flexibility for future needs. It essentially makes the platform an open hub where data can flow in or out, ensuring Starfolk’s team isn’t locked in and can connect their internal system to other services as needed.

#### *Additional Helpful Features*

To truly be an **all-in-one management tool**, we plan a few additional features that, while not explicitly requested, could greatly benefit Starfolk’s operations: \- **Knowledge Base / Document Management:** An internal wiki or knowledge repository for storing important documents, SOPs, product guides, and meeting notes. This can help new team members get up to speed and serve as a reference for everyone. We could implement a simple rich-text or markdown based article system with categories (e.g. “Product Specs”, “Marketing Guidelines”, “Sales Scripts”). A searchable knowledge base ensures that key information is centralized and not lost in emails or chats[\[10\]](https://softhealer.com/it-company-management-system#:~:text=Knowledge%20%26%20Documentation).  
\- **Customer Support (Ticketing):** If Starfolk provides customer support for its products, integrating a basic ticket system would allow tracking of customer issues and inquiries. For instance, a support ticket module could let the team log customer requests or bug reports, assign them to team members, link to the relevant client and product, and track status until resolution. This ties in with CRM (giving a 360° view of a client – sales and support history together). While a full helpdesk is extensive, a minimal ticket log with email integration (customers can email support@starfolk and it logs a ticket) could significantly improve customer service management.  
\- **Calendar & Scheduling:** A unified calendar view that shows upcoming tasks deadlines, scheduled social posts, and campaign send dates. This helps in planning and ensures no overlaps or missed timings. We might integrate with external calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook) so users can subscribe to their task deadlines or campaign schedules.  
\- **Notifications & Alerts:** The system will provide in-app notifications for key events (new task assigned to you, deal moved to next stage, etc.). In addition, email notifications or browser push notifications can be enabled for certain events or daily digests. This keeps everyone informed without having to constantly check the app.  
\- **File Storage and Asset Management:** A centralized library for digital assets (images, logos, marketing collateral) could be useful so that email campaigns and social posts can easily reuse approved graphics. Each module (tasks, CRM, knowledge base) will allow file attachments via an uploads system (with files stored on the server or cloud storage). This ensures relevant files are always attached to the work items and easy to find.  
\- **Scalability & Future Integrations:** The architecture (Laravel backend, MySQL, Vue frontend) will be designed with modularity so new features can plug in. For example, if in future Starfolk wants to integrate accounting software or an HR module, we can add those. The system could integrate with payment gateways or subscription management (for SaaS product revenue tracking) down the line. Our design philosophy is to create a **central hub** for Starfolk’s data that can grow with the company.

All these additional features are aimed at **managing Starfolk’s operations more holistically**. They ensure that as an internal tool, it covers not just sales and marketing, but also internal knowledge and possibly customer success, making it a truly unified platform. We will prioritize which of these to include in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) versus which can be phased in later, based on Starfolk’s immediate needs and development resources.

### Non-Functional Requirements

 * **Tech Stack:** The application will be built with **Laravel** (PHP) on the backend and **Filament v4** for the server-driven UI. Filament provides a modern, responsive, and interactive admin experience, leveraging Laravel’s robustness for APIs and business logic. The UI will use a clean, responsive design with **Tailwind CSS** for a consistent look-and-feel.

* **Database:** **MySQL** will be used to store application data (contacts, deals, tasks, etc.). We'll design a relational schema optimizing for the described features (with proper indexing for search and retrieval). Given the user count (1-10) and moderate data volumes (likely thousands of contacts at most and similar scale for tasks, etc.), MySQL will easily handle the load.

* **Security:** All access will be authenticated. We’ll use Laravel’s security features (hashed passwords, auth tokens) and implement role-based access control for endpoints and UI components. Sensitive integrations (API keys for social media, email SMTP credentials, AI API keys) will be stored securely (in .env config and not exposed to the client). The web app will be served over HTTPS to protect data in transit. We will also log user activities (audit log) for important actions like data export or deletion.

 * **Performance:** As an internal tool, performance needs are modest, but we will ensure efficient queries and use caching for expensive operations (e.g. caching API responses for the dashboard on a hourly basis to avoid hitting rate limits or slowing the UI). The app should load quickly and be responsive on modern browsers. Filament’s server-driven UI ensures fast interactions and a smooth user experience. We aim for page load times under 2 seconds on average.

* **Self-Hosted Deployment:** The system will be deployed on Starfolk’s own server or hosting environment (possibly a VPS or cloud instance). We will containerize the app (Docker) or provide clear setup instructions so it can be easily installed and updated by Starfolk’s tech team. Backups of the MySQL database should be scheduled regularly (e.g. daily dumps) to prevent data loss. The system will run as a web application accessible via browser (no mobile app for now, though the responsive design means it can be used on tablets or phones if needed).

* **Maintainability & Extensibility:** Using Laravel means a structured MVC architecture. We will document the code and provide a README for how to configure integrations (e.g. generating API keys for Facebook). Modular design (separating CRM, tasks, etc., in the codebase) will allow future enhancements with minimal impact on existing features. We’ll also write unit tests for core logic (like permission checks, data imports) to ensure reliability as the system grows.

* **Analytics & Logging:** Aside from the business KPIs, we will also include basic application analytics/logging – for example, error logging (Laravel’s logging to files or services) to catch and fix issues, and perhaps simple usage logs (like how often modules are used) to identify what features deliver the most value or if any training is needed for the team.

* **Compliance:** Since client data (names, emails) will reside in the system, we should ensure compliance with any data protection laws applicable (e.g. GDPR if any EU data, or local regulations). This means providing ability to delete or export a contact’s data on request, and ensuring we only collect necessary data. Email campaigns will include necessary unsubscribe functionality to comply with anti-spam laws (CAN-SPAM, etc.).

In summary, this product will serve as the **central nervous system for Starfolk’s operations**, covering client relationship management, task/project tracking, marketing automation, content creation, and performance analytics in one integrated, secure application. By implementing the above requirements, Starfolk’s team will be empowered to manage and grow their business more efficiently and intelligently from a single platform.

## User Stories

Below are the key user stories that capture the desired functionality from the perspective of various users (roles) in the system. These user stories cover the journey from initial setup to daily operations, ensuring we address all core requirements:

1. **As an Admin, I want to configure user roles and permissions,** so that I can control access to different parts of the system for up to 10 users (e.g., limiting sensitive data to managers only).

14. **As a Team Member, I want to update the status of a task (or add comments/files),** so that everyone knows its progress or any blockers (keeping collaboration in context of the task).

15. **As a Product Manager, I want to add a new product entry into the system,** so that we can start tracking tasks, deals, and metrics related to that product.

16. **As a Product Manager, I want to view a product’s dashboard (tasks, deals, KPIs specific to it),** so that I have a focused view of how that particular product is doing and what efforts are ongoing.

17. **As a Marketing Specialist, I want to compose an email campaign to a segment of leads or clients,** so that I can announce updates or promotions via email from within our system.

18. **As a Marketing Specialist, I want to use a template or previous email as a starting point,** so that I can quickly create a professional-looking email without starting from scratch each time.

19. **As a Marketing Specialist, I want to schedule an email campaign for a future date/time,** so that I can target optimal send times or coordinate with product launch timings.

20. **As a Marketing Specialist, I want the system to track email opens and link clicks for my campaign,** so that I can gauge engagement and success of the email and adjust future strategies accordingly.

21. **As a Marketing Specialist, I want to create and queue social media posts (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) from the system,** so that I can plan our social content in advance and not have to post manually on each platform.

22. **As a Marketing Specialist, I want to be able to upload an image or creative and include it in a social post,** so that our posts are visually engaging and consistent with our branding.

23. **As a Marketing Specialist, I want to schedule social posts on a calendar,** so that I can ensure we have a steady social media presence and avoid clashing posts across channels.

24. **As a Marketing Analyst, I want the system to fetch and display metrics from our social media (likes, shares, comments, followers) and ad campaigns (impressions, clicks, conversions),** so that I can evaluate how our online presence and ads are performing without logging into separate platforms.

25. **As a Marketing Analyst, I want to see which leads or sales resulted from which channel (email, Facebook, etc.),** so that I can attribute success to the right marketing efforts (e.g., identify that 50% of Q3 leads came from Instagram ads).

26. **As a Content Creator, I want to use an AI assistant to generate a draft blog post or social media copy by inputting a brief,** so that I can save time in content creation and focus on refining the best ideas the AI provides.

27. **As a Content Creator, I want to review and edit AI-generated content before approving it,** so that I ensure the tone and facts are correct and aligned with our brand (the AI gives me a head start, but I fine-tune the final output).

28. **As a Content Creator, I want to save generated content (blog or social posts) in the system,** so that I can easily find and reuse content or collaborate with others on editing it.

29. **As an Executive, I want to see a dashboard of key performance indicators when I log in,** so that I immediately get an overview of the company’s health (sales figures, new leads, active customers, campaign performance, etc.).

30. **As an Executive, I want to customize which KPIs or charts appear on my dashboard,** so that I can focus on the metrics that matter most to me or my role.

31. **As an Executive, I want to receive a weekly summary report (via email or on the dashboard) of our KPIs,** so that I stay informed of trends (for example, weekly lead count, revenue, task completion rate) without having to manually compile data.

32. **As an Admin, I want to configure webhooks for certain events (like new lead or deals closed),** so that external tools or notifications can be triggered in real-time (for example, notifying a Slack channel when a big deal is won).

33. **As an Admin, I want the system to handle incoming webhooks (e.g., from a website form or third-party service),** so that data from external sources (like form submissions or payment events) can automatically create or update records in our system.

34. **As an Admin, I want to maintain a knowledge base of internal documentation,** so that team members can easily find SOPs or product info within the same tool (reducing the need for separate wiki software).

35. **As a Support Agent (future role), I want to log customer support tickets and link them to client records,** so that I can track issue resolution and see a customer’s full history in one place *(potential future feature story)*.

36. **As a User, I want the system to be responsive and usable on web browsers of various devices,** so that I can check information or update something on-the-go (though it’s a web app, it should still work on my phone or tablet browser).

37. **As an Admin, I want to ensure all data is backed up and secure,** so that our internal tool is reliable and we don’t risk losing critical information (this might involve setting up automated backups and role-based access as part of system usage).

*(The above user stories encompass initial setup, daily usage of CRM, tasks, marketing, content, analytics, as well as administration and some forward-looking capabilities. They ensure that from project start to launch, we have covered the perspective of different users and their interactions with the system.)*

## Breakdown of User Stories into Development Tasks (GitHub Issues)

Below is a breakdown of the work required to implement the above user stories. These are grouped by feature/module for clarity, and each can be considered a task or GitHub issue to assign to developers. The numbering references the user stories where applicable.

### User Management & Roles Tasks

 * **Setup Authentication & Filament Integration:** Install and configure Filament v4 in the project. Verify that basic auth (login, registration, password reset) works. *(Supports Story 1, 36\)*

* **Implement Role Model & Permissions:** Add a Role model and a permission system (e.g., using a package like Spatie Laravel Permissions or custom tables). Seed the database with initial roles (Admin, Sales, Marketing, etc.) and permissions (manage\_clients, manage\_tasks, view\_dashboard, etc.). *(Story 1\)*

* **User Role Management UI:** Create an admin UI page to manage users and their roles. This includes listing users, inviting/adding a new user, assigning one or multiple roles, and editing or removing users. Ensure only Admin can access. *(Story 1\)*

* **Role Permissions UI:** Provide an interface for admins to create new roles or modify permissions of roles. This can be a form with checkboxes of all possible permissions under each role. *(Story 1\)*

* **Middleware/Policy Enforcement:** Implement Laravel middleware or policies on routes and controllers to enforce permissions. E.g., only users with “manage\_clients” can access CRM contact creation endpoints, etc. Test various role scenarios to ensure security is correct. *(Story 1\)*

* **Audit Log (Optional):** Log critical actions (login, data export, delete actions) for security auditing. *(Supports reliability, not tied to a single story)*

### CRM (Clients & Leads) Tasks

* **Database: Contacts/Leads Schema:** Create migrations and models for Contact (or Client) and Lead (if treating them separately, or a single Contact model with a status field for lead/client). Include fields: name, email, phone, company, status, source, etc., and timestamps. Possibly have a one-to-many relation from Contact to Deals. *(Story 3, 4\)*

* **Contacts CRUD Backend:** Implement Laravel controllers and services for creating, reading, updating, and deleting contacts. Include validation (e.g. email format, required fields). *(Story 3, 4\)*

 * **Contacts CRUD UI:** Build Filament resources for listing all contacts (with search & filter by status), viewing a single contact’s details (and related deals or activities), creating a new contact/lead, and editing a contact. Ensure a smooth UX (possibly modals or separate pages for create/edit). *(Story 3, 4\)*

* **Lead Status & Conversion Logic:** Add functionality to mark a contact’s status (Lead, Qualified Lead, Customer, etc.). Implement a conversion action – e.g. a button “Convert to Customer” that toggles status and perhaps triggers creation of a related client profile if using separate tables. *(Story 4, 9\)*

* **Import Leads (Optional):** If needed, implement a CSV import for contacts to bulk upload existing lead lists. *(Enhancement for ease of onboarding data)*

* **Website Form Webhook Endpoint:** Create an open endpoint (with a secret token) to receive data from website forms. When hit, parse the input and create a new Lead in the system. Ensure security (token check) and perhaps queue the processing. *(Story 5, 33\)*

* **Facebook Lead Ads Webhook Handling:** Similar to above, set up an endpoint to catch Facebook Lead Ad callbacks (which likely come via a subscribed webhook). Map the incoming fields to our Lead model and save. *(Story 5, 33\)*

* **Contact History Sub-feature:** On contact detail view, display a timeline of interactions (e.g. emails sent, tasks or notes, deals associated). This involves pulling data from other modules (emails, deals) filtering by that contact. *(Supports Story 4, 8 – gives context on contact)*

* **Validation & Edge Cases:** Ensure duplicate detection (maybe warn if a new lead email matches an existing contact), and handle edge cases like missing info or failed webhook deliveries (with retries or logging).

### Deals Pipeline Tasks

* **Database: Deals Schema:** Create a Deal model and migration. Fields: title, associated contact (relation), associated product (optional relation), value, stage, status (open/won/lost), expected\_close\_date, etc. *(Story 6\)*

* **Deals Controller & API:** Implement backend logic for creating deals (likely from a lead’s page or a general “new deal” form), updating deal details (stage changes, marking won/lost, editing fields), and listing deals. Ensure business rules: e.g. if marking as won, auto update contact status; if lost, require a reason note. *(Story 6, 7, 9\)*

 * **Deals UI \- Creation:** Provide a Filament form (possibly accessible from a contact’s profile like “Add Deal for this Lead”) to create a new deal. Or a global “Add Deal” with a dropdown to select a contact and product. *(Story 6\)*

 * **Deals UI \- Pipeline View:** Develop a Kanban board or table view in Filament that displays deals grouped by stage columns. Users should be able to update a deal’s stage via actions or dropdowns. Each card or row shows key info: deal name, value, client name. *(Story 7\)*

 * **Deals UI \- List/Detail:** Alternatively or additionally, provide a Filament table view of deals (filter by stage, owner, product). Clicking a deal shows detail (full info, timeline of changes, associated contact link). *(Story 8\)*

* **Deal Stage Configuration:** Seed the system with default stages and allow admin to configure stage names/order (either via a config file or an admin UI for pipeline settings). *(Supports customization)*

* **Deal Won/Lost Flow:** Implement the actions/buttons for marking a deal as **Won** or **Lost**. If Won: set status, maybe prompt to input actual closed value if different, create an entry in contact’s activity (and possibly trigger an email or task for onboarding the new client). If Lost: prompt for reason and record it. These actions should also move the deal to a Closed section of the pipeline. *(Story 9\)*

 * **Sales Reports (Basic):** On the pipeline page or a separate “Deals Insights”, calculate summary stats: total open deals count and sum, total won this month, win rate, etc. Display these as small highlights above or below the pipeline using Filament widgets. *(Story 8\)*

* **Notification on Deal Events:** If enabled, send a notification or email to relevant users on key events (e.g. a deal marked won could alert finance or the team). This can tie into the webhook config as well for Slack. *(Story 32\)*

### Task Management Tasks

* **Database: Tasks Schema:** Create Task model and migration. Fields: title, description (text), due\_date, status, priority, assignee\_id (relation to User), creator\_id, possibly related product or contact (nullable relations), and a project/tag field if grouping. *(Story 10, 11, 13\)*

* **Task CRUD Backend:** Implement endpoints for creating tasks, editing, deleting, and listing. Include business logic like default status \= “Todo” and default assignee \= creator if not specified. Ensure only creator or assignee or managers can edit certain fields (or define rules clearly). *(Story 10, 11, 14\)*

 * **Task Creation UI:** Build a Filament form (possibly modal or separate page) to add a new task. The form should allow selecting an assignee from users, setting due date (date picker), priority (Low/Med/High), and linking to a product or contact if relevant (dropdowns). *(Story 10, 11, 13\)*

 * **Task List UI:** Create Filament resource pages showing tasks. Possibly multiple views:

* *My Tasks:* tasks assigned to the logged-in user, grouped by status or due date.

* *All Tasks or Project Tasks:* if a project or product filter is selected, show tasks for that grouping.

* *Overdue Tasks:* highlight tasks past due in red, etc.  
  Provide quick actions like marking complete (maybe a checkbox or action). *(Story 12, 13\)*

 * **Kanban Board UI (Tasks):** Implement a board or grouped table view for tasks by status (To Do, In Progress, Done) using Filament. Useful for project or team overview. *(Story 12\)*

 * **Task Detail & Comments:** Provide a detailed view or expandable section for each task to see full description, attached files, comments, and history (created date, completed date) using Filament. Allow users to add a comment (which tags the task with updated activity). Possibly allow @mentioning other users in comments to notify them. *(Story 14\)*

* **File Attachment on Tasks:** Integrate file upload (using Laravel file storage) so users can attach relevant documents or images to a task. Show attached files in task detail. *(Supports Story 14\)*

* **Task Notifications:** When a task is assigned to a user or when someone comments on a task assigned to a user, trigger a notification (in-app bell icon and/or email). Ensure the assignee gets alerted for new tasks and approaching deadlines (e.g., a daily email of “Tasks due tomorrow” could be an added feature). *(Story 10, 14\)*

* **Project/Category Grouping:** Implement a simple way to group tasks, either by a field (like project name or product link). Possibly tasks have an optional “project” field (string or select) or a many-to-many tag relationship. Provide UI to filter tasks by these groups. *(Story 13\)*

* **Recurring/Template Tasks (Future):** Not for MVP unless needed, but note as future – ability to create recurring tasks (like weekly report tasks) or task templates. *(Future enhancement)*

### Product Management Tasks

* **Database: Products Schema:** Create a Product model and migration. Fields: name, type (SaaS or Info or other category), description, launch\_date, status (active, in development, archived), maybe an external link field (URL to product site) and any other relevant metadata (version, etc.). *(Story 15\)*

* **Product CRUD:** Implement backend for adding/editing products. Only certain roles (Product Manager or Admin) can add or modify. Validation for required fields and unique product name perhaps. *(Story 15\)*

* **Product UI \- List:** A page listing all products with basic info and maybe key KPIs (like a column for current user count or revenue if we have that data). *(Story 15, 16\)*

* **Product UI \- Detail Dashboard:** Build a dashboard page for each product. This page should aggregate:

* Product details (description, launch date, links).

* Related tasks: list or count of open tasks tagged with this product.

* Related deals: any open or recent deals for this product (if deals have a product field).

* Product-specific KPIs: allow input or display of metrics like “Active Users: 500” or “Total Sales: $XYZ”. Initially, we might create a simple mechanism to input these manually (an update form for product metrics), unless an integration is available (like pulling from an internal API or database of the SaaS product).

* Maybe a placeholder for graphs (e.g., a monthly active user trend if data is available). *(Story 16\)*

* **Linking Other Modules to Product:** Ensure tasks and deals can be associated with a product:

* For Tasks: include a product selector in task creation (done in Task Creation UI above).

* For Deals: include product selector (if a deal is specifically for selling a particular product).

* When viewing a product, filter tasks and deals by that product ID to show relevant items. *(Story 16\)*

* **Product Metrics Input (Admin UI):** If not integrated with external analytics yet, create a simple admin form under product detail where someone can input current metrics (e.g. update “current MRR” or “user count” each month). Store these in a related table for historical tracking or just update fields for current values. (Could be expanded to an integrated metrics collection in future).

* **Product Archive/Retire:** Provide an option to mark a product as archived/retired so it doesn’t show in active lists (in case Starfolk discontinues a product). Ensure this doesn’t delete data but hides it unless specifically viewing archived. *(Maintenance task)*

### Email Marketing Tasks

* **Database: Email Campaign Schema:** Create tables for email campaigns and perhaps email templates. Campaign fields: subject, content (HTML/text), sender (could use a default), segment or recipients (store criteria or snapshot of recipients), status (draft, scheduled, sent), scheduled\_time, and stats (counts of sent, opens, clicks). EmailTemplate (optional) fields: name, content, etc., to store reusable templates. *(Story 17, 18, 19\)*

* **Email Compose UI:** Develop a UI for creating a new email campaign. This includes:

* Choosing recipients: options to select all leads, all clients, or an existing segment (we might define simple segments like lead status \= X, or let user use filters like in contacts list and “Select All”). For MVP, even a multi-select of contacts could work if segments are too complex.

* Entering subject and body. Provide a rich text editor for the body, or at least a textarea that supports HTML. Possibly include a “insert placeholder” for personalization (e.g., %NAME% to be replaced with contact’s name).

* If templates exist, allow choosing a template to preload the content.

* Option to send a test email to oneself before scheduling.

* Schedule field: choose “Send now” or pick a date/time (with date-time picker). *(Story 17, 18, 19\)*

* **Email Sending Backend:** Implement logic to send the emails. Likely using Laravel’s Mailable or Notification system in a queued job for scalability. When the scheduled time arrives (via a cron or queue scheduler), send emails individually to each recipient, substituting any personalization tags. Use a configurable mail driver (SMTP, Mailgun API, etc. as per Starfolk’s IT setup). Ensure to handle bounces or errors (log failures). *(Story 17, 19\)*

* **Open/Click Tracking Mechanism:** Implement tracking pixels and link redirect for metrics:

* Opens: Include a small transparent image in emails with a unique ID tied to the campaign and recipient. When that image URL is hit, mark that recipient as having opened (this requires a route to serve the image and record the open).

* Clicks: Replace actual hyperlinks in the email with redirects through our system (e.g. a route like /email/click/{campaign\_id}/{contact\_id}?url=...). When user clicks, our system logs the click then forwards them to the real URL. This is advanced but will provide the data for open rate and CTR. *(Story 20\)*

* **Email Campaign Tracking UI:** On the campaign detail page, display statistics: X emails sent, Y opened (% open rate), Z clicked (% click rate). Possibly list which contacts opened (or at least counts). This can be updated in real-time or after sending. *(Story 20\)*

* **Campaign List UI:** Page to list all campaigns with status (draft, scheduled, sent) and key stats. Allows user to click to see details or create a new campaign. *(Story 17, 20\)*

* **Email Template Management:** Optional – allow user to save the content they just composed as a template for reuse, or create templates separately. This could be a simple CRUD of templates. *(Story 18\)*

* **Bounce/Unsubscribe Handling:**

* Unsubscribe: Add an unsubscribe link at the bottom of bulk emails. Create a route that, when clicked, marks that contact as unsubscribed (could be a field on contact or a separate suppression list). Ensure future campaigns exclude those contacts. Also, if a user is unsubscribed, maybe show that in their CRM profile.

* Bounces: If using an email service that notifies of bounces, we’d handle that via webhook or report and flag those emails as invalid. This might be outside MVP unless needed. *(Compliance task)*

* **Two-Way Email Sync (Future):** Not for MVP, but note that integrating with Gmail/Outlook (as some CRMs do[\[11\]](https://www.nutshell.com/marketing/resources/crms-and-email-marketing#:~:text=incredibly%20tedious.%20Nutshell%E2%80%99s%20time,messages%20in%20seconds%2C%20not%20minutes)) could allow logging individual emails. Likely skip for now due to complexity.

### Social Media Integration Tasks

* **OAuth Integration for Facebook/Instagram:** Implement a flow to connect a Facebook account (which can manage FB pages and Instagram accounts via Meta Graph API). Use Facebook’s OAuth to get a token with permissions for posting and reading ad data. Store the token securely. *(Story 2, 21\)*

* **OAuth Integration for Twitter (X):** Similarly, implement OAuth for Twitter to get access token for posting tweets and reading profile data. *(Story 2, 21\)*

* **Social Account Link UI:** In an “Integrations” settings page, provide buttons like “Connect Facebook Account” and “Connect Twitter Account”. Show status if already connected and allow disconnect/reconnect. *(Story 2\)*

* **Posting to Facebook/Instagram:** Use the Meta API to post content:

* For Facebook: endpoint to post to a Page’s feed.

* For Instagram: endpoint to post an image and caption (requires the image to be hosted or uploaded via their API). Might need to ensure the account is a business account with API access. Implement backend methods to call these APIs with the content from our system. *(Story 21, 22\)*

* **Posting to Twitter:** Use Twitter API to send a tweet (text and image). *(Story 21, 22\)*

* **Schedule Posts Mechanism:** Develop a scheduling system for social posts. Perhaps similar to email, store scheduled posts in a SocialPost model with fields: content, image (file path or URL), scheduled\_time, platform, status. A scheduler (cron job) will periodically check for due posts and then call the appropriate API to publish. Mark as sent once done. *(Story 23\)*

* **Social Content UI:**

* Compose Social Post form: Let user select platform (or multiple platforms for the same content?), enter text, attach image (upload and store file or URL), and choose immediate or schedule time. If multiple platforms at once is complex, we can do one at a time for MVP.

* Scheduled Posts Calendar: Create a calendar view (perhaps using a JS calendar library or a simple table by date) that shows all scheduled posts and past posts. This helps users visualize the posting schedule. Allow drag-drop or rescheduling if possible. *(Story 23\)*

* History/Feed: Show a list of posts that were published (with date/time and maybe link to the actual post if available), and whether it was successful. *(For record-keeping)*

* **Social Metrics Fetch (Facebook/Instagram):** Use Graph API to fetch metrics:

* Facebook: number of likes, comments, shares on each post (if we store post IDs), or overall page insights (likes count, reach).

* Instagram: likes and comments on posts, follower count. We likely need to store IDs of posts we publish so we can query their stats later. Alternatively, query the last X posts on the linked accounts and get stats. Implement a backend job to fetch these periodically (daily) and store metrics or update a cached value. *(Story 24\)*

* **Social Metrics Fetch (Twitter):** Twitter’s API might provide tweet metrics (likes, retweets). Similarly, gather for tweets posted via our system (store tweet IDs) or fetch timeline if needed. Also fetch follower count. *(Story 24\)*

* **Ad Campaign Data Fetch (Meta Ads):** Use Facebook Marketing API to retrieve ad campaign performance data. This may require additional permissions in OAuth. We would identify the ad account and campaign IDs of interest (maybe store them in config or fetch all campaigns). Implement a scheduled job to pull metrics like spend, impressions, clicks, leads for each active campaign. Store summary results in a table or JSON. *(Story 24, 25\)*

* **Social & Ad Analytics UI:** Integrate the fetched metrics into the Analytics Dashboard:

* Create dashboard widgets for “Facebook Page Likes”, “Instagram Followers”, “Tweet Impressions”, etc., showing current values and maybe delta over last period.

* Create widgets for Ad campaigns: e.g. “FB Ads: 10 leads, $200 spend this week” or a small table of campaigns with their KPIs. Additionally, possibly a dedicated “Marketing Analytics” page to detail these, but the main goal is to reflect them in the KPI dashboard and allow drill-down. *(Story 24, 25\)*

* **Lead Source Attribution:** When new leads are created via webhooks (from FB ads or website), tag them with a source (e.g., “Facebook Ad – Campaign X”). Ensure this source is stored in the lead’s data. Then in analytics, implement a report or at least data aggregation by source (like count of leads per source). This satisfies the need to see which channels produce leads/sales[\[8\]](https://www.flowlu.com/blog/crm/integrate-your-social-media-with-crm/#:~:text=By%20integrating%20Social%20Media%20with,ambitious%20marketing%20and%20sales%20goals). *(Story 25\)*

* **Error Handling for API calls:** Implement robust error handling and logging for all external API interactions. If a post fails (network issue, token expired), log it and notify via the UI (so user knows their scheduled post didn’t send). Also handle token refresh if needed (Facebook long-lived tokens, etc.). Provide a way to re-auth if tokens expire.

### AI Content Generation Tasks

* **AI Provider Integration:** Set up integration with an AI content generation API (e.g. OpenAI). This involves obtaining API credentials and using their SDK or REST endpoints. Ensure to store the API key securely in config. *(Story 2, 26\)*

* **Content Generation Backend Service:** Implement a service class or controller that accepts parameters like content type (blog, social, ad, email) and a prompt/brief, calls the AI API with a suitable prompt template, and returns the generated text. Possibly break this into different prompt templates per content type (to guide the AI style/length). *(Story 26\)*

* **Content Generation UI:**

* Create a page or modal where a user selects the type of content they want to generate. Depending on type, present relevant fields: e.g., for blog post – topic or title, tone; for product copy – select product and highlight points; for social post – topic and desired style (e.g., humorous/professional).

* Include an explanation that the AI will produce a draft which they can edit.

* When user submits, show a loading indicator while AI is generating, then display the generated content in a text area or editor where the user can modify it. *(Story 26, 27\)*

* **Edit & Save Generated Content:** Allow the user to save the AI-generated (and edited) content into the system. We might create a ContentPiece model with fields: type (blog, social, etc.), content (text), related product (optional), created\_by, and maybe a title. Saving this allows future reference. *(Story 28\)*

* **Content Library UI:** Provide a section to view saved content pieces. This could be a simple list grouped by type or date. The user can click to copy or use the content (for instance, an action “Use this for a new Social Post” which would take them to the social post form with content pre-filled). *(Story 28\)*

* **Quality Control Mechanism:** (Optional) Implement a character/word limit or simple heuristic checks on AI output (like if it's empty or too short, indicate generation failed and maybe allow retry). Also perhaps integrate OpenAI’s moderation API to ensure the content is safe (no disallowed content), since it's internal maybe less critical but still good practice.

* **Logging AI Usage:** Keep a log of prompts and outputs internally (for admins to review usage and for possible fine-tuning of prompt templates).

* **AI Settings (Optional):** A settings UI to adjust prompt parameters like creativity level (temperature) or length for advanced users, or to update the prompt templates without digging into code (could also be just config files initially).

### Analytics Dashboard & KPI Tasks

* **Dashboard Backend Prep:** Determine which metrics require queries vs. which require external API calls. Implement backend functions to gather:

* From internal DB: counts of new leads, count of deals won in last X days, sum of deal values, count of tasks completed vs total, etc. Use efficient queries (possibly add some summary tables or SQL views if needed for speed).

* From external: ensure social and email metrics are fetched (from tasks above). Possibly store daily snapshots to allow trend graphs.  
  Possibly create a new table for storing daily KPI snapshots or just compute on the fly for recent period.

 * **Dashboard UI Layout:** Design Filament dashboard pages showing multiple widgets. Likely use a grid of cards:

* Numeric summary cards (with icons) for headline numbers (e.g. “Leads (This Month): 50”, “Deals Won: 10 ($5k)”, “Open Tasks: 8”, “Email Open Rate: 45%”, etc.).

* Charts: Use Filament chart widgets or integrate charting libraries for trends. For example: a line chart of leads per week over the last 8 weeks, bar chart of deals by stage, pie chart of lead sources, line chart of website visits if available, etc.

 * **Populate Dashboard Data:** Use Filament dashboard widgets and backend queries to load all needed data in one go (to minimize multiple API calls). The controller could gather all KPI data and return in a single payload. Then the dashboard assigns each widget the data. *(Story 29\)*

 * **Interactivity:** Allow date range selection on the dashboard (a dropdown: Last 7 days, Last 30 days, Custom range). When changed, refetch or recalc the data for that range and update charts using Filament widgets. *(Story 30\)*

 * **Drill-down Links:** Make dashboard widgets clickable if relevant – e.g. clicking “50 New Leads” takes user to CRM filtered by leads created this month; clicking a chart segment might filter to those records. Implement these links/filters where practical using Filament actions. *(Story 29\)*

 * **Customization Options:** Provide a way for users to customize which widgets they see (this could be simple: e.g., allow hiding certain sections via user settings, or drag-reorder of widgets if ambitious). At minimum, ensure the design is responsive so on smaller screens widgets stack. *(Story 30\)*

* **Weekly Summary Email:** Implement a scheduled job (Laravel command) that runs weekly (say Monday 8am) to compile key metrics from last week and email them to interested users (maybe all admins or a list in settings). The email could include a few top stats (leads, sales, etc.) and a link to the full dashboard. Provide a setting for users to opt-in to this email. *(Story 31\)*

* **Testing Dashboard Data:** Write tests or manual scripts to simulate data and verify the calculations (e.g., 10 leads in DB \-\> dashboard shows 10 for that period, etc.). Ensure external data is handled gracefully if, say, API is down (dashboard should show “N/A” or last known value with a warning rather than crash).

### Webhooks & Integration Tasks

* **Outgoing Webhook Infrastructure:** Design a mechanism for outgoing webhooks:

* A table WebhookEndpoint with fields: event (e.g. "lead.created", "deal.won"), target\_url, maybe a flag active, and optionally an auth token to send along.

* Admin UI to create a new webhook entry: choose event from a list (we’ll enumerate events like Lead Created, Deal Won, Task Completed, etc.), input the URL, and a secret (optionally).

* Code in relevant places (after creating a lead, after winning a deal, etc.) to detect if any webhook is registered for that event and queue a job to POST the event data to the target\_url. Include a payload JSON with details (e.g., for lead.created: lead info fields; for deal.won: deal info and client info, etc.), and include a header or parameter for the secret for verification.

* Implement retry logic for webhooks (if endpoint returns non-200 or times out, retry a couple times with backoff) and log failures. *(Story 32\)*

* **Incoming Webhook Endpoints:**

* Create routes/controllers to handle specific incoming webhooks we expect:

  * Generic catch-all endpoint (for say Zapier or custom integrations) which can map payload fields to a certain action (this is complex, may not do generic for MVP).

  * Specific ones: e.g. /webhooks/lead-form for our website form, /webhooks/fb-lead for Facebook leads, /webhooks/stripe for payment events (if we integrate later).

* In these controllers, verify a token or signature if provided (for example, Stripe and Facebook have their own signature headers). If verified, parse the payload and perform the action (create a Lead, etc.).

* Test these with sample payloads. *(Story 33, relates also to Story 5 which was capturing external leads)*

* **Webhook Admin UI:** Besides adding endpoints, show a log of recent webhook deliveries (at least whether they succeeded or failed) to help debug. Could be a simple table with timestamp, event, URL, status, last response code.

* **Integration Settings Page:** Possibly combine OAuth connections and webhook settings in a single “Integrations” section in the UI. This is where an Admin would go to configure any external connectivity (social accounts, API keys for AI, webhook endpoints, etc.). *(Story 2, 32, 33\)*

* **API Key Management (if needed):** For certain integrations like AI or maybe Google Analytics, allow storing API keys. Provide secure input fields and mask the values. Use these keys in respective service calls.

### Knowledge Base / Documentation Tasks (Optional Module)

* **Knowledge Base Schema:** Create Article model with fields: title, content (text/HTML), category, author, maybe tags. Possibly a simple versioning or at least updated\_at tracking. *(Story 34\)*

* **Knowledge Base UI:** A section where users can browse articles by category or search by keywords. Implement a markdown editor or rich text editor for creating articles (for ease, could use a simple textarea with Markdown support library).

* **Article CRUD:** Allow certain roles (Admin or a Documentation role) to create and edit articles. Others can have read-only access. Implement controllers for CRUD operations.

* **Link with Products or Tasks:** If useful, allow linking an article to a product (e.g., product documentation) or to tasks (if a task requires following an SOP, link the SOP article).

* **Access Control:** All internal users can likely read the knowledge base. Writing can be limited. Ensure sensitive info in knowledge base stays internal (the app is internal anyway).

* **Search Function:** Implement a basic search (SQL full-text or just title/content LIKE search) to find relevant articles by keyword.

### Customer Support / Ticketing Tasks (Future Enhancement)

*(These can be noted but perhaps not implemented in MVP unless decided to include)* \- **Ticket Schema:** Model for SupportTicket with fields: contact (who reported, link to CRM), subject, description, status, priority, created\_by (staff), assigned\_to (staff handling), created\_at, closed\_at. \- **Ticket UI:** Form to create a ticket (either manually by staff when a customer emails/calls, or via incoming email parsing if automated). List view of open tickets and their statuses. Detail view with conversation (staff can add updates, mark resolved). \- **Email Integration:** Could set up a specific email (like support@) that forwards to this system – out of scope likely. Instead, maybe just manual entry for now. \- **Link to CRM and Tasks:** On a contact’s page, show their tickets. Possibly create tasks from tickets if they involve development fixes. \- **SLA/Notifications:** If support is mission-critical, add alerts if a ticket is open too long. But likely not needed for a small team.

Each of these tasks would be created as an issue in GitHub, with labels to indicate the feature area. Developers can pick up issues in parallel where feasible (e.g., one works on backend models and APIs while another designs the frontend components). The tasks are written granular enough to implement and test individually, but some may be further broken down during sprint planning if needed (for example, “Social Metrics Fetch” could be split into FB and Twitter separately).

By completing all the above tasks, we will cover all the user stories and functional requirements outlined for Starfolk’s management system. This breakdown also leaves room for iterative improvement and adding the “extra” features as needed. The result will be a cohesive, powerful internal platform that meets Starfolk’s current needs and can expand in the future.
